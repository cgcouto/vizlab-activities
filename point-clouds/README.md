## Point clouds

### Requirements

* numpy
* gala
* astropy
* h5py

### Explanation

To generate some point clouds for the VizLab, we'll be using a stellar stream simulator from the Gala library. 

### What next?

Run the provided code to generate and plot a 3D stellar stream according to some . Here are some ideas for making the stream your own:

* Adjust the starting position of the stellar stream (x, y, z)
* Adjust the starting velocity of the stellar stream (vx, vy, vz)
* Adjust the mass of the stars within the stream (prog_mass)
* Adjust the age of the stars within the stream (age)
* For visualization purposes, tweak your preferred stream color (color)
