## Photospheres

### Requirements

None

### Explanation

We won't be generating our own photospheres here (maybe in future versions of this repo), but there are lots of exciting astronomy photospheres out there. Feel free to browse the ESO's archive (https://www.eso.org/public/images/archive/category/360pano/?sort=-release_date) as well as NOIRLab (https://noirlab.edu/public/images/archive/category/360pano/) and any other sources you can find!
